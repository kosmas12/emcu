# EMCU

EMCU (Emulator of MicroController Units) is a program meant
to simulate microcontroller units, boards and electronic
circuits driven by them. It's meant to cover as many
MCUs, boards and components as possible, with the ability
to define custom boards and components, wire them up,
program them and then run on the simulator.
